# Day 06 - Red
Fire departments and isochrones in minutes

![06](06.png)

The isochrones were generated through the valhalla routing engine: https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla
The batch generation of isochrones is done in the index.js in this folder. The Polygons generated by valhalla are not ideal. If using them in QGIS best run a "fix geometries" script.
